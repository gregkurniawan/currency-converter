## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Since I will be visiting some family out of the country soon, I decided to use this opportunity to practice API's and async/await and create a simple currency converter. Using async/await, I fetched some API data, converted them to json, and inputted them into the options tag of the html. Furthermore, I used the API to convert the desired currencies into json and outputed it into the DOM.

## Optimizations:
I initially built this project using Promises, but before pushing onto GitHub, decided to optimize it using async/await.

## Lessons Learned:
The idea behind this project was to develop a better understanding of async/await, which, in turn, would produce better, cleaner code. Mission accomplished!
